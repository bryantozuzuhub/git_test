# git_test

the scope
- write out 10 algebraic phrases using the following:
declaring variables and constants
basic operators
strings an numbers to include concatenation and literals

pseudocode
1. Circle Area

- Declare a constant PI and a variable radius.
- Calculate the area of a circle (PI * radius²).
- Log the result as: "The area is [result]."

const pieValue is 3.14
let radiusValue is 5.06
let outputResult is pieValue * (radiusValue * radiusValue)
console.log (the area is outputResult)

2. Age Difference

- Store your age and a friend's age in variables.
- Calculate the difference in ages.
- Log: "Our age difference is [difference] years."

let myAge is 18
let myFriendAge is 22
let totalAge is myAge - myFriendAge
"Our age difference is [difference] years."

3. Temperature Conversion

- Declare a variable celsius for a temperature.
- Convert it to Fahrenheit (F = (C * 9/5) + 32).
- Log: "[C]°C is [F]°F."

let tempCelsius is 25
let tempFahrenheit is (tempCelsius * 9/5) + 32
"[C]°C is [F]°F."

4. Rectangle Perimeter

- Store a rectangle’s length and width.
- Compute its perimeter (2 * (length + width)).
- Return: "The perimeter is [perimeter] units."

let rectLength is 30
let rectWidth is 44
let rectTotal is (2 * (rectLength + rectWidth))
"The perimeter is [perimeter] units."


7. String Greeting

- Declare variables for firstName and yearOfBirth.
- Calculate the person’s approximate age.
- Log: "Hello, [firstName]! You're about [age] years old."

let firstName is Daquon
let yearOfBirth is 2000
let age is yearOfBirth plus 25
"Hello, [firstName]! You're about [age] years old."
